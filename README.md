Course description:
This first programming course in C# introduces students to topics that may
include intermediate implementation of control structures, the problem-solving
process, completing the problem-solving process and getting started with C#,
variables, constants, arithmetic operators, and assignment statements, built-in
functions, program-defined value-returning functions, and program-defined void
functions. Student will be learn to write C# programs that include classes,
polymorphism, overloading, exception handling, and interfacing with databases.

Course Learning Outcomes/Assessment Measures:
By the end of this course, the student will be able to:
• Design, build, execute and debug C# applications.
• Use variables, strings, dates, arrays, and collections in C# applications.
• Use flow control statements in C# applications.
• Utilize exception handling and data validation to deal with system and user
errors.
• Use the basic concepts of object oriented programming to create C#
applications.
• Use proper object-oriented programming techniques as evidenced by
programming assignments and practical mid-term and final exams.
• Build coding interfaces implementing classes, as evidenced by programming
assignments and practical mid-term and final exams.
• Retrieve and display information from a database, as evidenced by programming
assignments and practical mid-term and final exams.
• Explain and document their code and projects, as evidenced by their code
documentation and explanations within the class discussions as well as those
specifically with the teacher.
• Students will demonstrate the necessary steps involved in developing small to
medium-sized applications/programs from start to finish as evidenced by the
satisfactory completion of the required Lab Assignments and the Cumulative
Practical Final Exam.
• Where industry data is requires, students will complete the research and analysis
necessary to legally and ethically apply the appropriate coding and data within
their technical documents, and code implementation.
• Explain and document their code and projects.

B. COLLEGE POLICIES
Academic Integrity Policy:
Academic dishonesty is prohibited in any form here at the university. Academic
dishonesty includes but is not limited to cheating, fabrication, facilitation of dishonest
actions, plagiarism, and improper use of one’s own work.
• Cheating—intentional use or attempted use of deception as one's academic
work;
• Fabrication—intentional falsification and/or invention of any information or
citation;
• Facilitating dishonesty—intentionally working with others to commit an act of
dishonesty;
• Plagiarism—failing to credit the work of others, copying and pasting materials
from the web or another student, or using an author’s words/work as one’s own,
even if the source citation is provided;
• Improper use of one’s own work—the unauthorized act of submitting work for a
course that includes work done for previous courses and/or projects as though
the work in question were newly done for the present course/project.
Any project, paper, or examination is expected to be the student’s own work, and in the
student’s own words. Willful academic dishonesty (specific examples include but are not
limited to: copying and pasting materials from online sources with or without proper
citation; copying another student’s work or allowing one’s own work to be copied; using
notes, books, or electronic devices during assessments without the instructor’s
advanced permission to the entire class; presenting information or images copied from a
book, journal, or online source as one’s own; or using instructors’ test banks) will not be
tolerated. Attempts to engage in any of the conduct described above or the facilitation of
any of this conduct by another individual will be treated as conduct constituting academic
dishonesty for purposes of this policy.
Notwithstanding, a student with a disability may be permitted to use notes, books, or
electronic devices during assessments if the course instructor has been informed by the
504 Coordinator that the use qualifies as a reasonable accommodation for that student
Page 4
Course Syllabus
based on a diagnosed disability as long as the accommodation does not affect the
academic integrity of the course as determined by NEIT.
The instructor reserves the right to submit any student submission to TurnItIn, a
plagiarism checking tool. By taking this course, the student agrees that all submitted
work may be examined for detection of plagiarism.
For the full Academic Integrity Policy, please see the Student Handbook.
Writing:
All writing in the course (including discussion board responses and email) should be at a
college level and include proper grammar, punctuation and spelling. You may be asked
to re-write careless submissions to reach a college level.
Other Policies:
Each student is responsible for becoming familiar with the Academic Policies and
Procedures and University Policies and Procedures sections of the Student Handbook
published on the Student Website.
The design of this course as outlined in the syllabus requires you to do work
outside of class to be successful.
C. ONLINE COURSE POLICIES

Course Syllabus
Please note that technical problems with your computer/software are not considered an
acceptable excuse for missed work. It is recommended that you develop a back-up plan
in case of technological difficulties.
Digital Citizenship Policy
• Be respectful of other people and their opinions.
• Write clearly and pick your words carefully, avoiding humor and sarcasm. Visual
cues used to convey meaning when speaking with others in a face-to-face
environment are missing in online communications, so be sure to convey your
thoughts carefully. Posts based upon race, religion, color, national origin, age,
sex, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, genetic information, or
disability, out of the context of the discussion, generally are inappropriate.
• Do not post or distribute material that would offend or frighten a reasonable
person.
• Inflammatory, condescending, harassing, or derogatory remarks are
inappropriate.
• Use proper spelling, grammar, capitalization, and punctuation. Using all capital
letters in online communications is considered SHOUTING.
• Use emoticons, (e.g. smiley faces) and chat acronyms (e.g. LOL, BRB) sparingly
because they could be misinterpreted.
• Be aware of plagiarism and copyright guidelines. Cite your sources and refrain
from posting or distributing content that is copyright protected.
D. ACADEMIC SUPPORT
Academic support services are available through the Academic Skills Center, Student
Support Services, and the Library as well as in the department. See the tutoring
